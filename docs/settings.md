Play from the LBW when possible.  These have better page turns and include [add link] things missing from the ELW.

## ELW Liturgy Excerpts

The beginning of the ELW hymnal has liturgical movements from various settings.  Here are ones we use.

::: danger
The ELW settings 3 and 4 are missing the phrase before/after the gospel, the Meal, and the accompaniment to the Great Thanksgiving

## Additional Settings


### Bread of Life

This is from the With One Voice settings, page 31

### Now the Feast

This is a [single setting](sources.md#now-the-feast).  Several of these are easier to play [from the ELW](settings.md#elw-liturgy-excerpts).
